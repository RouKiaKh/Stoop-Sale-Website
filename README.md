# Stoop-Sale-Website
I build a website for Brooklyn Stoop Sale using HTML, CSS, JS

in the first page i put a welcome picture with QR code for the map and some sales with slogans, and i have a Navbar contains three links to three pages (Clothes, Shoes and Bags), i can put the date and the time in the welcome page, and in the pages : Clothes, Shoes and Bags it should be a link to back to the first page but it shows only in the small screen like phones and it hides in big screens (this problem could be solved later)
